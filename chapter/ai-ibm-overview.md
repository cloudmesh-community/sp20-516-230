# IBM Cloud

IBM Cloud is a set of cloud computing services including both PaaS and IaaS. 
IBM IaaS can deploy and access virtualized IT resources, such as compute
power, storage and network on the Internet. Bare-metal or virtual servers are
also available for computations. Using IBM Cloud PaaS, users can use IBM
services to create, manage and run different types of applications. 
   
IBM Cloud platform supports other IBM tools and over 170 services across
various categories. It allows companies to automate decision making, make 
predictions of a higher accuracy, and essentially eliminate manual
processes to allow employees to focus on higher valued work. The AI
Services in IBM covers areas such as cognitive customer care, discovery 
and insights, and risk and compliance services. On the other hand, the
services can be categorized by types such as Storage (object, block and 
file storage for cloud data), Management(tools to manage and
monitor cloud deployments), Analytics (data science tools such as Apache
Spark, Apache Hadoop, IBM Watson Machine Learning, and analytics
services for streaming data)[@sp20-516-252-IBM-cloud].

# AI Services on IBM Watson

Like said before, Watson is supported by IBM Cloud platform. It is a set of AI
services, applications and tools that facilitate enterprises to gain insights. 
Watson aims to free customers from repetitive tasks, and allows them to focus
on more creative and valuable tasks. Specifically, Watson automates data
analysis process, and uses data to build models and make predictions for

# IBM Watson Machine Learning

IBM Watson Machine Learning is one of the tools offered by Watson. It helps
developers and data scientists streamline machine-learning and AI deployment. It 
enables businesses to harness AI at scale across different clouds. Key
 features include:
  
  - Build and deploy models using IBM Watson Studio and open source tools;
  - Re-train models dynamically;
  - Generates APIs to build AI-based applications;
  - Simplify model management and deployment end-to-end with a user-friendly
   interface[@sp20-516-252-machine-learning].

# IBM Kubernetes Service

The IBM Cloud Kubernetes service is an open source, highly available, container
deployment platform. It allows for automatic deployments, scaling, and
management of applications. Its aim is to provide a cost-effective tool for
its users [@sp20-516-230-kubernetes]. It allows users to securely integrate
with other IBM products.
